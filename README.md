The Expert System uses a Knowledge Base(written in Datalog) which contains the data to be displayed in the Streamlit Page. 
The system lists likely diseases in reference to the symptoms the user inputs via the drop-down menu.
As for when more than 1 disease can arise from the symptoms, a most likely disease is listed.(I do assume I can improve that system, But I will come back to it later.)
The system also contains a list of Pests and their controls, which are categorised.
The Streamlit Page(There are 2 current versions), are also in Visual and Visual2.
